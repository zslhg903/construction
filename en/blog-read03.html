<p>First, why do you need a construction plan permit?</p>

<p>Most of the houses now require a Planned Permission if they need Loft Conversion and a rear extension, so the four-point house has been removed from the planning bureau's system. Appropriate attic renovations will be granted the right to automatically obtain permission to the construction plan for the expansion of the home.

	Why do you need a construction plan license? Because the construction plan permits the British government to manage town planning through local authorities. The mechanism is the responsibility of the authorities' The Development Control Department.
	
	The planner will see if the house is expanded or added to meet the overall characteristics of the building in the area, or does not affect the privacy of others or add unnecessary burdens, such as parking lots, and can provide suitable facilities for future users, such as Outdoor space, the size of the room is acceptable and there is plenty of natural light. Special buildings also have special regulatory requirements such as scenic spots, historical sites, green belts and protected areas. The most common is the restriction on the status of protected areas. These are all for the protection of the regional landscape. The main concern is how the appearance of the house from the street will affect the whole. Therefore, the reconstruction of the house, such as the renovation of the attic and the replacement of the windows, are subject to management control.
</p>

<p>Second, how to apply for a construction plan permit?</p>

<p> If you need to approve the alteration or addition, you need to apply to the authorities before the construction starts. You need to provide relevant information, such as detailed application form, house plan, plan of expansion or addition, proof of ownership of the property and related Application fee, etc. After the Council receives your application, the first thing to do is to seek the opinions of the applicant's neighbors. The neighbors must state within 21 days, and then the authorities will consider your application. They may also go to the scene to observe and then according to the situation. Decide whether to approve the application directly, inform you of the specific time at which you can start work, or ask for more supplementary materials. If there is a third party objecting to the project proposal, the application will be handed over to the Planning Committee for processing. Usually, the authorities should issue the final approval result to you within 8 weeks.
