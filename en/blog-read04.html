<h3>How to apply building regulations?</h3>

<p>If China wants to stamp or expand its own house, what materials are used, it will not be too strict by the government. However, it is different in the UK. Although it is a house of its own, if it is to be rebuilt, it will be fitted with an external door or new glass.
  Wall insulation or insulation, or the need to provide access to facilities for people with disabilities, is subject to government control. If you don't understand the relevant laws and regulations, decorate your house according to your own wishes.
  After being discovered by the authorities or subjected to complaints from neighbors, the consequences may be that they are ordered to return to the original ocean or re-established. There is government regulation, which is a great guarantee for the landlord.
  Because the decoration company has rules to follow, there are laws to follow, and truly meet the standard safety construction.</p>


<p>British building decoration regulations</p>


<p>There are two departments in the local council related to the building decoration, one is Building regulation, the other is Planning, the two can not be confused. Some projects require two departments to approve and approve at the same time. Some projects require only one of the departments to approve the license. Some small projects are not needed for both. The specifics depend on the nature and requirements of the construction.
  So which projects need building regulations? Based on our work experience, we summarized the following points:</p>

    <p>Addition and expansion projects;
           Change the structure of the house, including the removal of chimneys, the installation of new window guards and gates, the removal of interior walls, etc.;
           Sanitary equipment, drainage systems, and fixed heating and hot water systems;
           Changing the use of existing homes; newly installed gas and circuit switches;
           The warmth of the façade and the sound insulation of the party wall;
           Fire, flood and moisture protection measures;
           The attic was converted into a habitable room;
           Structural changes in the house, such as the removal or partial removal of the load-bearing wall; installation of new boilers;
           Changes in roofing materials (whether changing and lighter or heavier);
           Replace the window guard or the gate;
           All new electrical work.</p>


<p>How to apply building regulations？</p>

<p>There are two ways to apply. The third method is to submit a comprehensive and detailed construction plan, fill out the application form, pay the relevant fees, and submit a formal application to the local planning department. The Building Surveyor will check the draft construction plan proposal and, if it complies with the building regulations, issue a notice of approval to the company.
  The second method is to submit a detailed construction plan, a direct notice notice, a description of the construction plan and a scale block plan to explain the location and scope of the expansion. The notice will take about 2 business days to have results. However, the disadvantage of the second method is that the previous planning permission has not been obtained. During the construction, the Wanhao plan is proposed to be changed, and it is necessary to reverse the work.
  In different construction stages, the concrete construction team needs to notify the building control officer at different construction stages to ensure that the project meets the specifications, such as the basic depth of the ground, the materials and measures used for moisture and waterproofing, etc. They do the final inspection. If the project meets the building code and the results are satisfactory, the authorities will issue a completion certificate.</p>
<p>Of course, not all projects require government approval. Small-scale independent buildings that do not include living conditions, greenhouses, porches, and storage rooms can usually be reinstated. The last suggestion is that with the idea of remodeling, the safest thing is to check the corresponding regulations on Shangguan.com, and to consult the local council, which is more targeted.</p>
